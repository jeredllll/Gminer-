# Gminer-
GMiner由高性能计算和密码学领域的俄罗斯专家小组创建。 GMiner的第一版于2018年9月21日发布，受到了用户的一致好评。 由于其独特的开发和稳定性，在短短六个月内，该矿机就成为Equihash算法的最爱。 该矿机专注于NVIDIA和AMD平台，并支持最流行的算法，例如：Ethash，ProgPoW，KAWPOW，Equihash，CuckooCycle。 GMiner在诸如Beam，Grin，Cortex，Bitcoin Gold等硬币的开采中保持领先地位。 2020年，该矿机增加了对Ethash，ProgPoW和KAWPOW算法的支持，相对于竞争对手而言，该算法具有更高的性能。 开发团队永远不会止步于已取得的成就，并以最小的功耗实现算法的最佳性能，正是这些品质使GMiner与竞争对手区分开来并赢得了用户的青睐。GMiner was created by a Russian group of specialists in the field of high performance computing and cryptography. The first version of GMiner was released on September 21, 2018 and was received quite warmly among users. Thanks to its unique developments and stability, in just six months, the miner became a favorite on the Equihash algorithms. The miner is focused on NVIDIA and AMD platforms and supports most popular algorithms such as: Ethash, ProgPoW, KAWPOW, Equihash, CuckooCycle. GMiner maintains a leading position in the mining of such coins as Beam, Grin, Cortex, Bitcoin Gold. In 2020, the miner added support for Ethash, ProgPoW and KAWPOW algorithms with high performance relative to competitors. The development team never stops at what has been achieved and achieves the maximum performance of the algorithms with the minimum power consumption, it is these qualities that distinguish GMiner from the competitors and win the hearts of users.
